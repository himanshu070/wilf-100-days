Resource Allocation Strategies:
Resource allocation strategies in operating systems involve efficiently managing and distributing resources among processes. Key resources include CPU time, memory, files, and I/O devices. Here are some common resource allocation strategies:

Contiguous Memory Allocation:

Allocates a contiguous block of memory to a process.
Simple and efficient but can lead to fragmentation issues (external and internal).
Paging:

Divides physical memory into fixed-sized blocks (pages) and processes into blocks of the same size.
Reduces external fragmentation but may lead to internal fragmentation.
Segmentation:

Divides the logical address space into segments (sections with varying sizes and purposes).
Provides flexibility but may lead to fragmentation.
Virtual Memory:

Allows a process to use more memory than physically available.
Pages are swapped in and out of the disk as needed.
Process Synchronization Beyond Petersonâ€™s Solution:
Semaphore:

A synchronization tool that restricts the number of simultaneous accesses to shared resources.
Includes operations like wait (P) and signal (V).
Mutex (Mutual Exclusion):

Ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time.
Typically used to protect critical sections.
Monitors:

High-level synchronization construct.
Encapsulates shared data and the procedures that operate on the data.
Ensures mutual exclusion and coordination among processes.
Deadlock Detection and Prevention:
Deadlock Detection:

Periodically checks the system to determine if a deadlock has occurred.
If detected, various strategies can be employed to recover from it.
Deadlock Prevention:

Involves ensuring that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot hold.
Examples include resource allocation policies and avoiding circular waits.
Thread Scheduling Policies:
First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS):

The process that arrives first is scheduled first.
Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF):

Selects the process with the shortest total remaining processing time.
Priority Scheduling:

Assigns priorities to processes and schedules based on priority levels.
Can be preemptive or non-preemptive.
Round Robin Scheduling:

Allocates a fixed time unit (time quantum) per process in a cyclic manner.
Reduces wait time but may lead to high turnaround time.
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):
Determinism:

Guarantees that operations complete within a specified time frame.
Essential for applications with strict timing requirements.
Task Scheduling:

Prioritizes tasks based on their urgency and importance.
Ensures timely execution of critical tasks.
Interrupt Handling:

Efficiently manages interrupts to respond quickly to real-time events.
Resource Management:

Optimizes resource allocation for real-time tasks.
Minimizes response time for critical processes.
